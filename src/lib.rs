//! Ying is a native Rust sampling memory profiler which tracks retained memory and allocations.  It is designed for
//! production usage in asynchronous Rust programs.  Ying(é·¹) is Chinese for eagle.  ðŸ¦…ðŸ¦…ðŸ¦…
//!
//! I started this experiment because existing solutions I looked at were either consuming too much resources, or wrote
//! profiling files that were too large or too cumbersome to consume, or were very bad at producing useful stack traces
//! especially for Rust async programs, or did not support tracking retained memory in its profiling.
//!
//! Features:
//! * Sampling profiler, so it uses little enough resources to be useful in production
//! * Track retained memory, including reallocs, as well as total allocations
//! * Targets async Rust programs (especially Tokio apps that use tracing for instrumentation), so you know the stack
//!   traces will be useful
//!   - Specific support for tracing spans and finding allocations by span
//!   - Removes extra `::poll::` lines in the stack trace for clarity
//! * Support for detecting leaks or large amounts of allocated memory that has not been freed
//!   - Tracks realloc() calls as single long-lived allocation
//! * Automatic and easy flamegraph generation
//! * Allocation lifetime/length histogram
//! * Track span information (need feature profile_spans) in stacks
//! * Get top stack traces by total allocation
//! * Get top traces by retained allocation
//! * `ProfilerRunner` -- utility to spin up thread to dump out reports and optionally flamegraphs every N minutes when
//!   total memory usage changes significantly
//! * Catch and prevent single allocations greater than say 64GB, dump out giant allocation stack trace
//!
//! To see an example which uses Ying and dumps out top stack traces by allocations:
//!
//! `cargo run --profile bench --features profile-spans --example ying_example`
//!
//! ## How to use
//!
//! ```rust
//! use ying_profiler::YingProfiler;
//!
//! #[global_allocator]
//! static YING_ALLOC: YingProfiler = YingProfiler::default();
//! ```
//!
//! The above sets Ying as the global allocator but does not dump out any profiles or stats.  Underneath Ying collects
//! stats and defers to the original System global allocator.
//!
//! To dump out stats, one can use methods in `YingProfiler`, but the easiest way is to use `ProfilerRunner`, which
//! starts up a background thread, checks memory use stats, and dumps out reports if the change in memory usage exceeds
//! some threshold.  The default checks every 5 minutes and dumps out a report if the retained memory changes by more
//! than 10%.  Options include a path to write out the text reports to, and if inlined stack frames should be expanded
//! in the reports.
//!
//! ## Why a new memory profiler?
//!
//! Rust as an ecosystem is lacking in good memory profiling tools.  [Bytehound](https://github.com/koute/bytehound)
//! is quite good but has a large CPU impact and writes out huge profiling files as it measures every allocation.
//! Jemalloc/Jeprof does sampling, so it's great for production use, but its output is difficult to interpret, and
//! it does not track retained memory, which is quite critical for debugging memory issues in production.
//! Both of the above tools are written with generic C/C++ malloc/preload ABI in mind, so the backtraces
//! that one gets from their use are really limited, especially for profiling Rust binaries built for
//! an optimized/release target, and especially async code.  The output also often has trouble with mangled symbols.
//!
//! If we use the backtrace crate and analyze release/bench backtraces in detail, we can see why that is.
//! The Rust compiler does a good job of inlining function calls - even ones across async/await boundaries -
//! in release code.  Thus, for a single instruction pointer (IP) in the stack trace, it might correspond to
//! many different places in the code.  This is from `examples/ying_example.rs`:
//!
//! ```bash
//! Some(ying_example::insert_one::{{closure}}::h7eddb5f8ebb3289b)
//!  > Some(<core::future::from_generator::GenFuture<T> as core::future::future::Future>::poll::h7a53098577c44da0)
//!  > Some(ying_example::cache_update_loop::{{closure}}::h38556c7e7ae06bfa)
//!  > Some(<core::future::from_generator::GenFuture<T> as core::future::future::Future>::poll::hd319a0f603a1d426)
//!  > Some(ying_example::main::{{closure}}::h33aa63760e836e2f)
//!  > Some(<core::future::from_generator::GenFuture<T> as core::future::future::Future>::poll::hb2fd3cb904946c24)
//! ```
//!
//! A generic tool which just examines the IP and tries to figure out a single symbol would miss out on all of the
//! inlined symbols.  Some tools can expand on symbols, but the results still aren't very good.
//!
//! ## Tracing support
//!
//! To add support for memory profiling of [tracing Spans](https://docs.rs/tracing/0.1.36/tracing/struct.Span.html),
//! enable the `profile-spans` feature of this crate.  Span information will be recorded.
//! NOTE: This feature is experimental and does not yet yield useful information.  It also causes a panic when
//! used with `tracing_subscriber` due to a problem with `current_span()` allocating and potentially causing a
//! RefCell `borrow()` to fail.
//!
